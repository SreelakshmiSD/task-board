# Task Card Labels System

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive labeling system for your task cards, similar to Trello's labels feature. This allows you to categorize and organize your tasks with colored labels.

## Features

### üè∑Ô∏è Predefined Labels
The system comes with 8 predefined labels with distinct colors:

- **Could** - Green label for optional features
- **Should** - Yellow label for recommended tasks  
- **Must** - Red label for critical/required tasks
- **Reminder** - Purple label for follow-up items
- **Priority** - Blue label for high-priority tasks
- **Bug** - Orange label for bug fixes
- **Feature** - Indigo label for new features
- **Review** - Pink label for items needing review

### üé® Visual Design
- Each label has a distinct background color with white text for maximum readability
- Labels appear as small rounded badges on task cards
- Multiple labels can be applied to a single task
- Labels are displayed prominently below the task title

### üñ±Ô∏è Easy Management
- Click the "More" button (‚ãØ) on any task card
- Select "Edit Labels" to open the label picker
- Use checkboxes to select/deselect labels
- Changes are applied instantly

## How to Use

1. **Open Label Picker**: Click the three-dot menu on any task card and select "Edit Labels"

2. **Select Labels**: Check the boxes next to the labels you want to apply to the task

3. **View Labels**: Selected labels will appear as colored badges on the task card

4. **Remove Labels**: Uncheck labels in the picker to remove them from the task

## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified
- `TaskCard.tsx` - Added label picker UI and label display
- `TaskColumn.tsx` - Added label change prop passing
- `page.tsx` - Added label change handler
- `api.ts` - Updated mock data with sample labels

### Data Structure
Labels are stored in the `tags` field of each task as an array of strings:
```typescript
task: {
  id: 1,
  title: "Sample Task",
  tags: ["Must", "Priority", "Bug"]
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Styling
Labels use Tailwind CSS classes for consistent styling:
- Background colors: `bg-green-500`, `bg-red-500`, etc.
- Text color: `text-white` for all labels
- Size: `text-xs` with `px-2 py-1` padding
- Shape: `rounded` corners

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a solid foundation that can be extended with:

1. **Custom Labels**: Allow users to create their own labels with custom colors
2. **Label Categories**: Group labels by type (priority, status, department, etc.)
3. **Label Filtering**: Filter tasks by selected labels
4. **Label Analytics**: Show task distribution by label
5. **API Integration**: Persist label changes to your backend API

## Sample Data

I've updated the mock data to include sample labels on existing tasks so you can see the system in action immediately.

The labeling system is now fully functional and ready to use! You can start organizing your tasks with the predefined labels right away.
